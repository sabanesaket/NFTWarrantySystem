# Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs

This project was done under Flipkart Grid 4.0 Hackathon!

In today's world, almost everyone shops for different products which come with warranty. Some products have 6 month warranty, some have 12 month warranty. Till date, the warranty system exists only on paper, that is by the use of warranty cards or bills.

So this innovative idea will help the retailer as well as the customer to know accurately about the product and the warranty details, as they will be written on the blockchain as soon as the customer purchases a product. Thus this information will be centralized and thus in case of any conflict between customer and retailer, or two customers, this information can be handy, and can be easily verified as it is on a centralised database (Blockchain).

This project also allows NFTs to be transferred to the new owners, if in case the product is resold. This helps the retailer/manufacturer track the latest owner of the product so that it is easy for him as well for further service if needed.
